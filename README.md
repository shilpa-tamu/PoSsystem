Cloud Based PoS System - Project Management


The Dessert Emporium, a small business that quickly grew to be a local favorite in Dallas, 
TX and Miami, FL is looking to expand their business and the owner has reached out to Get It Done Consulting 
to help him with this transition. Including the two primary locations, The Dessert Emporium will now branch out to 
over 25 locations in the next 5 years. We at Get It Done Consulting, will help achieve their goal by helping them set up 
a state-of-the-art PoS system. 

We plan on providing a scalable cloud-based system with minimal hardware footprint while ensuring integrated inventory tracking 
and mobile order taking capabilities. We will set our initial targets around understanding their existing system and analyzing their needs.
Then we shall explore and analyze the industry leading restaurant PoS vendors’ products to zero in on the best suited option for our client. 
Finally, we will move on to installation of secure Wi-Fi access points, deployment of the system along with the app-support and plan 
initial training and handover meetings before we take their business online. We plan to complete the project over a span of 6 months 
while adhering to a set budget of $350,000.00. 

We really are looking forward to seeing our client’s business expand and are sure that we would definitely “Get It Done” 
in the best possible way.
